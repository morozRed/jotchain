What's next:

1. Integrate https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/getting-started/overview
2. Add projects with many-to-many relation
3. Add AI integration
4. Email templates
5. Better scheduling for notifications, our screen looks weird and unprofessional, we should ensure that it's extendable and can later include slack and other channels (potentially)
6. Separate screen for projects to add ability to add description for them + list of notes related to them + latest summaries from AI
7. latest notes screen with calendar on top, each calendar square contains number of entries
8. Add "quality" to each note, so we can tell user how the quality of his writing improves over time
