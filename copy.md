# Landing Page Copy Outline

## 1) Hero
- H1 option: "Understand where your time and energy go."
- Subhead: "A lightweight work journal that turns short notes into quiet signals about blockers, time sinks, and invisible impact."
- Primary CTA: "Start free"
- Secondary CTA: "See how it works"
- Hero bullets:
  - "Write a quick note in 30 seconds."
  - "Signals appear only after patterns repeat."
  - "Reflection is optional, never forced."

## 2) Problem
- Heading: "Work disappears."
- Copy: "Interruptions, blockers, and helping others rarely make it into task tools. Weeks feel busy, but it’s hard to say why."

## 3) Solution
- Heading: "Notes in, signals out."
- Copy: "You write freely. JotChain watches quietly. Insights surface only when the data supports them."

## 4) How It Works (3 steps)
- Step 1: "Log what happened today."
- Step 2: "Signals show up when patterns repeat."
- Step 3: "Reflect or ignore. Both are valid."

## 5) Signal Types
- Blockers: "Waiting on review, CI issues, unclear requirements."
- Time sinks: "Meetings, coordination, context switching."
- Impact: "Helping others, unblocking, mentoring."

## 6) Example Signal Bar
- Visual + caption: "Thin top bar. Collapsed by default."
- Example text:
  - "Blockers (3)"
  - "Time sinks"
  - "Impact"

## 7) Why It Helps (Side Effects, not the product)
- "Performance reviews get easier."
- "Weekly updates become faster."
- "You see patterns, not just tasks."

## 8) Trust and Privacy
- "Your notes are private."
- "No public metrics. No streak pressure. Nothing is scored."
- "Core journaling and signals stay free."

## 9) Pricing (Simple)
- Free: "Daily notes + signals."
- Pro: "AI summaries, exports, and email digests."

## 10) FAQ
- "Is this task management?" -> "No. It sits beside Jira and Linear."
- "Do I need to write every day?" -> "No. A few notes per week still work."
- "When do signals appear?" -> "After a few days of notes."
- "Can I export my data?" -> "Yes, on Pro."

## 11) Final CTA
