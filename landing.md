## Adjusted Landing Page Copy

### 1) Hero

**H1 (stronger, more instrumental)**
Understand how your work has been unfolding.

**Subhead (less “journal”, more system)**
Jotchain observes short work notes and surfaces quiet signals about interruptions, unplanned work, and invisible impact — without metrics or pressure.

**Primary CTA**
Start free

**Secondary CTA**
See how it works

**Hero bullets (tightened, more confident)**

* Capture context in under 30 seconds
* Signals surface only when patterns repeat
* Reflection is optional, never required

---

### 2) Problem (Recognition)

**Heading**
Work feels busy — but hard to explain.

**Copy**
Interruptions, blockers, and unplanned help rarely show up in task tools. Weeks pass, effort adds up, and when it matters — reviews, retros, check-ins — it’s hard to say where your time and energy actually went.

---

### 3) The Shift (Important reframing)

**Heading**
Planning tools track intent. Jotchain observes reality.

**Copy**
Most tools focus on what you planned to do. Jotchain helps you notice what actually happened. It doesn’t optimize or score your work — it quietly observes patterns in what you write.

---

### 4) How It Works (Instrument model)

**Heading**
A calm, system-first workflow

**Steps (reworded)**

1. **Capture context**
   Jot short notes when something happens. No structure required.

2. **Observe patterns**
   Jotchain watches for repetition over time.

3. **Understand or ignore**
   When patterns emerge, you see a clear work-state readout. You can reflect — or not.

---

### 5) What You’ll Notice (Signals)

**Heading**
Quiet signals, not dashboards

**Signals (cleaner, less listy)**

**Interruptions**
Frequent context switching that breaks focus.

**Unplanned help**
Time spent unblocking others that never shows up anywhere.

**Blockers & friction**
Waiting, dependencies, and recurring slowdowns.

Short supporting line:
Signals appear only when there’s enough evidence — never on day one.

---

### 6) What This Gives You (Side effects, not the product)

**Heading**
Clarity, without extra work

**Bullets (reframed)**

* You see patterns, not just tasks
* Weekly updates become easier to write
* Conversations about work become concrete

Small note:
These are outcomes of observability — not goals you have to chase.

---

### 7) Performance Summaries (Side bonus, refined)

**Heading**
When you need a summary

**Copy**
Over time, Jotchain builds an understanding of how your work has unfolded. When it matters — performance reviews, retrospectives, or check-ins — you can generate a clear work summary based on real notes and observed patterns.

**Supporting line**
No templates to manage. No scores. No guesswork.

(One restrained screenshot of a generated summary is enough.)

---

### 8) Trust, Privacy, and Restraint

**Heading**
Built to stay calm

**Bullets (slightly refined)**

* Your notes stay private
* No public metrics, no streaks, nothing is scored
* Signals are observational, not evaluative

Optional line:
Jotchain is designed to reduce pressure, not add it.

---

### 9) Pricing (Keep simple)

**Free**
Notes and signals

**Pro**
Performance summaries, exports, and advanced AI-generated narratives

(Keep this understated — pricing is not the story.)

---

### 10) FAQ (Minor copy tweaks)

**Is this task management?**
No. Jotchain sits beside tools like Jira and Linear — it doesn’t replace them.

**Do I need to write every day?**
No. A few notes per week is enough for patterns to emerge.

**When do signals appear?**
Only after repetition. Jotchain stays quiet until there’s evidence.

**Can I export my data?**
Yes. Available on Pro.

---

### 11) Final CTA

**Heading**
See your work clearly.

**CTA**
Start free

**Optional reassurance**
No scores. No pressure.

## Key Improvements vs Your Original Copy

* Less “work journal”, more “system observing work”
* Fewer promises, more inevitability
* Performance reviews framed as a *derived artifact*
* Stronger differentiation from productivity tools
* Clearer “Whoop for work” implication without saying it

If you want next, I can:

* Rewrite this into **final polished landing copy** (word-for-word)
* Help you decide **which screenshots to show and where**
* Tune this for **SEO vs clarity tradeoffs**
* Stress-test this copy against skeptical engineers or managers

But structurally and tonally — this version is now **fully aligned with the product you built**.
