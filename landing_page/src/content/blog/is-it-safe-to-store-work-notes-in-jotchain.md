## The trust question

Before you put your work history into any tool, you should ask: Is this safe? Can I trust this with information about my job, my projects, and my career?

This is the right question to ask. Work notes contain sensitive information—project details, performance observations, career plans. You deserve to know how that information is protected.

Here's our approach to work notes security and why we believe JotChain is a trustworthy choice for storing work notes safely.

## What's at stake with work logs

Work notes can contain various types of sensitive information:

**Project details.** What you're working on, technical approaches, and business context that your employer might consider confidential.

**People references.** Mentions of colleagues, feedback you've received, interpersonal observations.

**Performance information.** Accomplishments, challenges, growth areas—information that affects your career.

**Strategic information.** Company priorities, upcoming initiatives, competitive insights.

The privacy of work logs matters because this information could harm you or your employer if exposed inappropriately.

## Our security approach

JotChain takes several measures to protect your data:

### Encryption at rest and in transit

All data stored in JotChain is encrypted. Data traveling between your device and our servers uses industry-standard TLS encryption. Your notes aren't sitting in plain text on a server somewhere.

### Authentication and access control

Your account is protected by secure authentication. Only you can access your notes. We don't have the ability to read your notes without explicit access that you would grant.

### Infrastructure security

JotChain runs on enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure with industry-standard security practices: regular audits, vulnerability scanning, and access controls.

### Data isolation

Your data is logically isolated from other users. There's no shared database where your notes might accidentally be exposed to others.

### Regular backups

Your data is backed up regularly, protecting against data loss from hardware failures or other issues.

## Privacy principles

Beyond technical security, we commit to privacy principles:

### Your data belongs to you

You can export your notes at any time in standard formats. If you decide to leave JotChain, your data goes with you.

### We don't sell your data

We don't sell, share, or monetize your notes or any derived information. Our business model is subscriptions, not data harvesting.

### Minimal data collection

We collect only what's necessary to provide the service. We don't track unnecessary behavioral data or build profiles for advertising.

### Transparency

Our privacy policy is written in plain language. We tell you what we collect and why. No surprises.

### No training on your data

Your notes are not used to train AI models. The AI summaries are generated from your data for you, not used to improve models that benefit others.

## What about AI processing?

When JotChain generates summaries from your notes, AI models process your text. Here's how we handle this:

**Processing is ephemeral.** Your notes are sent to AI for summary generation and then discarded. They're not stored in AI systems.

**Your notes aren't used for training.** Industry-leading AI providers offer enterprise agreements that explicitly exclude customer data from training. We use these.

**Summary generation is on-demand.** AI only processes your notes when you request a summary. Your data isn't constantly being analyzed.

## Practical considerations for secure productivity tools

When evaluating any productivity tool for work notes security, consider:

### Company policies

Does your employer have policies about where you can store work-related information? Some companies restrict use of personal tools for work data. Check before assuming any tool is appropriate for your situation.

### Sensitivity levels

Not all notes are equally sensitive. You might keep general accomplishments in a cloud tool while keeping truly sensitive information elsewhere. Consider what you're storing and whether the security level matches.

### Access patterns

Who else has access to your device? Your account? Consider physical security alongside cloud security.

### Backup strategy

Don't rely solely on any single tool. Export your notes periodically as a backup. JotChain makes this easy.

## Questions to ask any provider

Before trusting any tool with your work notes, ask:

1. **Where is data stored?** What infrastructure and jurisdiction?
2. **Who can access it?** Can employees read your notes?
3. **How is it encrypted?** At rest? In transit?
4. **What's the business model?** If it's free, are you the product?
5. **Can you export?** Is your data portable?
6. **What happens to deleted data?** Is it actually deleted?
7. **What security certifications do they have?** SOC 2? ISO 27001?
8. **What's the incident response plan?** How would they handle a breach?

We're happy to answer all of these for JotChain.

## Our commitment

We understand that trusting a tool with your career information is a significant decision. We take that responsibility seriously.

We're building JotChain for the long term, which means earning and maintaining trust through consistent security practices, transparent policies, and responsive support.

If you have specific security questions or requirements, reach out. We're happy to discuss details, provide documentation, or address specific concerns.

## The bottom line

Is it safe to store work notes in JotChain? We've built the platform with security as a foundational requirement, not an afterthought.

We encrypt your data, isolate it from others, and commit to privacy principles that respect your ownership and control. We don't sell your data or use it for purposes beyond providing you the service.

That said, security is a shared responsibility. Use strong passwords, be mindful of what you store, and understand your employer's policies.

With those considerations in mind, we believe JotChain is a trustworthy choice for storing work notes safely—and we work every day to keep it that way.
