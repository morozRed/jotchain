## The smallest habit with the biggest payoff

You don’t need a template. You don’t need categories. You just need two minutes at the end of your day.

### Step 1 — Write three bullets
- What you finished
- What you moved forward
- Any blockers worth noting

### Step 2 — Add lightweight context
- Mention the project or person: `@payments`, `@daria`
- Add a tag if helpful: `#infra`, `#release`

### Step 3 — Hit submit
JotChain turns those notes into a clean summary when you need it—before standups, reviews, or client check-ins.

## Why it works
- Low friction: text first, zero formatting rules
- High signal: entries are grounded in your actual work
- Compounds over time: you always know what you did

Do this for a week and notice how much easier updates become.
