## The prep tax before every meeting

Five minutes here, ten minutes there—meeting prep adds up. The bigger cost is cognitive: reconstructing what happened from tickets, docs, and chat.

## A lighter way to prepare

Log short notes during the day. Before the meeting, JotChain assembles:
- Key highlights
- Recent activity and wins
- Mentions of projects and people

You skim it in under a minute and share the same brief if needed.

## Works for all types of meetings
- Standups and weekly syncs
- 1:1s and skip-levels
- Client updates and demos

## Stay prepared without extra effort

You’re already doing the work. Capture it as you go; let AI do the rest.
