## AI can summarize, but only what you give it

AI has transformed many workflows, and summarization is one of its strongest capabilities. Feed it meeting transcripts, documents, or notes, and it produces coherent summaries in seconds. This sounds perfect for turning notes into summaries for standups, reviews, or status updates.

But there's a catch: AI can only summarize information that exists. If your notes are incomplete, vague, or missing context, no amount of AI magic will fill the gaps.

Understanding what AI for performance reviews and work summaries can and can't do helps you use these AI productivity tools for engineers effectively.

## What AI summarization does well

### Compressing volume

AI excels at condensing large amounts of text into key points. A week of detailed notes becomes a paragraph. A month of work becomes a page. This compression is genuinely useful.

### Identifying themes

Good AI tools recognize patterns and group related items. Scattered notes about various bug fixes become "Improved system stability through five bug resolutions."

### Improving language

AI can transform rough notes into polished prose. Bullet points become sentences. Technical jargon gets explained. The output is often more readable than the input.

### Saving time

The mechanical work of synthesis—reading through notes, deciding what matters, crafting sentences—takes significant time. AI handles this in seconds.

## What AI summarization struggles with

### Understanding importance

AI doesn't know which accomplishments mattered most. A minor bug fix and a major architecture decision might get equal weight unless you signal importance in your notes.

### Providing context

AI can't add context you didn't capture. If your notes say "fixed the bug," AI can't know it was a critical customer-facing issue that took three days to diagnose.

### Capturing impact

Business impact and quantitative results need to be in your original notes. AI can't invent metrics or determine that your optimization improved conversion rates.

### Avoiding hallucination

Some AI tools occasionally add plausible-sounding details that aren't in the source material. You need to review outputs carefully.

### Understanding your goals

AI doesn't know you're preparing for a promotion case versus a quick status update. It summarizes generically unless you provide specific instructions.

## Making AI summaries actually useful

To get value from using AI for work summaries, you need good input. Here's how:

### Capture with summaries in mind

When logging your work, include the information AI needs:
- What you did (the action)
- Why it mattered (the impact)
- Any relevant metrics or results
- Who was involved or affected

A note like "Fixed checkout bug" becomes "Fixed payment timeout bug that was blocking 3% of checkout attempts—resolved within same day after customer escalation."

### Be explicit about importance

Mark significant accomplishments clearly. Use tags, capitalization, or a "highlight" section. This helps AI (and your future self) identify what matters.

### Include context AI can't infer

If you led a project, say so. If you unblocked a teammate, note it. If something was particularly challenging, explain why. AI can only work with what you provide.

### Review and edit outputs

Never send an AI summary without review. Check for accuracy, add missing context, and ensure the tone matches your voice and the situation.

### Use appropriate prompts

When generating summaries, tell the AI what you need:
- "Summarize for a weekly status update to my manager"
- "Identify the top 5 accomplishments for a performance review"
- "Create a brief for a 1:1 meeting focusing on blockers and wins"

Different contexts need different summaries.

## AI meeting summaries: special considerations

AI meeting summaries have become common, with tools transcribing and summarizing meetings automatically. They're useful but have specific limitations:

### They capture what was said, not what was decided

Transcription captures discussion, but decisions often happen in subtext, follow-up messages, or assumptions. Review AI meeting summaries for accuracy of conclusions.

### They miss non-verbal context

Tone, enthusiasm, hesitation—these don't translate to text. An AI summary might miss that a "yes" was actually reluctant.

### They don't capture what you contributed

Generic summaries describe the meeting, not your specific contributions. For work tracking purposes, add notes about your participation.

### They work better for structured meetings

Meetings with clear agendas produce better summaries. Freeform discussions are harder to summarize meaningfully.

## A realistic workflow

Here's how to use AI summaries effectively:

**Daily:** Log your work with sufficient detail. Include context, impact, and importance markers.

**Weekly:** Use AI to draft a summary of your notes. Review and edit for accuracy. Add anything the AI missed.

**For reviews:** Generate a longer summary covering the review period. Significantly edit and expand—this document matters too much for raw AI output.

**For meetings:** Use AI meeting summaries as a starting point, but supplement with your own notes about decisions and action items.

## The bottom line

AI productivity tools for engineers are powerful assistants, not replacements for good habits. They amplify the value of well-captured notes but can't compensate for poor input.

The formula is simple:
- Good notes + AI = great summaries
- Poor notes + AI = mediocre summaries
- No notes + AI = nothing useful

Invest in the habit of capturing your work well, and AI becomes a genuine time-saver. Skip that step, and you'll be disappointed with what AI produces.

The future of work documentation is human capture plus AI synthesis. Get the capture right, and the synthesis follows naturally.
