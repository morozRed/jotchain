## The problem with daily standups

Standups are meant to align teams quickly, but they often spiral:
- Everyone waits their turn instead of listening.
- Updates are shallow and repetitive.
- Context is missing, so follow-ups spill into other meetings.

If this sounds familiar, your team is paying the “sync tax.”

## Why work journals are different

Work journals capture progress where it happens—during the day—so you don’t have to reconstruct it later. With JotChain:
- You jot quick notes while working.
- Mention projects and people for context.
- AI turns those notes into a clear summary for your team.

No extra ceremony. Real signal.

## When to use each

- Use standups when you truly need synchronous decisions or alignment.
- Use work journals to keep continuous visibility with low overhead.
- Combine both: keep the standup short by reading summaries first, then discuss blockers.

## A simple hybrid

1. Everyone writes a short journal by day’s end.
2. JotChain generates a team summary before the standup.
3. Standup is for decisions, not recaps.

The result: fewer meetings, better context, faster decisions.

## Try it for a week

Spin up JotChain, capture a week of notes, and let the summaries write themselves. You’ll know quickly whether you still need that daily meeting.
