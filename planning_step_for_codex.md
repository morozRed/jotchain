# Initial Explanation Stage

Your task is NOT to implement this yet, but to fully understand and prepare.

Here is exactly what I need implemented:

```
I want to improve @backend/app/frontend/pages/meetings/index.tsx screen so we can have a better way to setup schedule for a notifications. Right now we create dummy schedule manually but it's not what we
should do.

1. Remove creation of notification schedules on user create
2. Implement a form which allows us to setup custom notifications (via Email only for now)
3. Rename sidebar menu from meetings to "Notifications" (I think it's better)
4. Notification should give me a way to setup all the things I need as well as the channel (email only for now).
5. It should allow me to setup the number of days which will be used to generate summary (e.g. last day/month/week/year/half-year/custom number of days)
```

Your responsibilities:

- Analyze and understand the existing codebase thoroughly.
- Determine exactly how this feature integrates, including dependencies, structure, edge cases (within reason, don't go overboard), and constraints.
- Clearly identify anything unclear or ambiguous in my description or the current implementation.
- List clearly all questions or ambiguities you need clarified.

Remember, your job is not to implement (yet). Just exploring, planning, and then asking me questions to ensure all ambiguities are covered. We will go back and forth until you have no further questions. Do NOT assume any requirements or scope beyond explicitly described details.
